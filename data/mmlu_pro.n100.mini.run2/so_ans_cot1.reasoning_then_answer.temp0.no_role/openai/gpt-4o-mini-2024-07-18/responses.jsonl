The second type of conflict mentioned is where an individual's interests may conflict with that of their employer, which is commonly referred to as a conflict of 'Individual' and 'Organizational' interests. Therefore, the correct answer should include 'Organizational' and 'Professional' for the first type, and 'Individual' and 'Organizational' for the second type. Looking at the options, option B: Individual, Organizational, Personal, Professional fits this description as it includes 'Individual' and 'Organizational' for the second type, and 'Professional' for the first type. However, it does not include 'Organizational' for the first type. Therefore, we need to find an option that correctly represents both types of conflicts. The correct answer is option C: Professional, Personal, Organizational, Individual, which includes 'Professional' and 'Organizational' for the first type and 'Individual' for the second type.
