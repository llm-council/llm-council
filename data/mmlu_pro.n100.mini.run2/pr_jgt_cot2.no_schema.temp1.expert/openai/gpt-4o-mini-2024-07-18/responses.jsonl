A 5% certificate of deposit would yield a net return of:  \n   5% * (1 - 0.50) = 2.5%\n\n2. A 5% government bond (federally taxable) would yield a net return of:  \n   5% * (1 - 0.50) = 2.5%\n\n3. A 5% corporate bond (also taxable) would yield a net return of:  \n   5% * (1 - 0.50) = 2.5%\n\n4. A 5% treasury bond is typically subject to federal tax but exempt from state tax:  \n   Still, the net return would be:  \n   5% * (1 - 0.50) = 2.5%\n\n5. A 4% municipal bond is often exempt from federal taxes, so the after-tax return is:  \n   4% (since there are no federal taxes applied).\n\nComparing all these yields, the 4% municipal bond, which is tax-exempt, would actually provide a greater return (4%) than the 2.5% returns from any of the taxable options. Nevertheless, it is important to mention that municipal bonds can sometimes be subject to state taxes, but the wording suggests it is tax-exempt at the federal level, making it a better option than the other options listed in the 50% tax bracket.\n\nThus, the expert's choice of the 4% municipal bond is indeed better than the other options under consideration.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 293, "completion_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 653}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_48196bc67a"}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 116, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "openai://gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"}]
