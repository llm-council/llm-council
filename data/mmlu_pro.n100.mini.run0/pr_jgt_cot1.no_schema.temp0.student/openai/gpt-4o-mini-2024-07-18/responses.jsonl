Company A's net income is $96,000 on sales of $3,000,000, which gives it a net income margin of 3.2%. Company B has a higher net income of $272,000 on sales of $5,000,000, which gives it a net income margin of 5.4%. However, since Company X has strong administration, it might be able to improve Company A's sales more effectively than Company B's administration could improve its already strong sales.\n\n2. **Condition (b): X has a strong sales force but a weak administration.**\n   - Here, Company B could be the better choice. With a strong sales force, Company X could leverage Company B's higher sales potential and existing gross profit. Company B has a higher gross profit and net income, which could be beneficial for a company looking to maximize sales.\n\n3. **Condition (c): X is looking for short-term improvement in its profits.**\n   - Company B is likely the better option here as well, given its higher net income ($272,000) compared to Company A ($96,000).
