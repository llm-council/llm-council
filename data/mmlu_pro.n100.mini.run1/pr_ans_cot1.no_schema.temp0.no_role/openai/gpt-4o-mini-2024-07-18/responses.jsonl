Roosevelt - Led the U.S. through the Great Depression and WWII, implementing the New Deal and inspiring hope.\n\nD: Martin Luther King Jr. - A key figure in the civil rights movement, he inspired change through his vision of equality and non-violence.\n\nE: Mikhail Gorbachev - Introduced significant reforms (glasnost and perestroika) in the Soviet Union, leading to transformative changes.\n\nF: Nelson Mandela - A transformational leader in the fight against apartheid, promoting reconciliation and nation-building.\n\nG: Mahatma Gandhi - Led India to independence through non-violent resistance, inspiring millions with his vision of peace.\n\nH: Jawaharlal Nehru - The first Prime Minister of India, he played a significant role in shaping modern India and its policies.\n\nI: Bill Clinton - While he had a significant presidency, he is often viewed more as a pragmatic leader rather than a transformational one.\n\nJ: Margaret Thatcher - Known for her strong leadership style and significant economic reforms, but her approach was more polarizing.\n\nAmong these leaders, while all have had significant impacts, Bill Clinton is often seen as more of a pragmatic leader rather than a transformational one, especially when compared to the others who are widely recognized for their transformational qualities.\n\nThe answer is (I)", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 127, "completion_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 504}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_507c9469a1"}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 200, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "openai://gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"}]
