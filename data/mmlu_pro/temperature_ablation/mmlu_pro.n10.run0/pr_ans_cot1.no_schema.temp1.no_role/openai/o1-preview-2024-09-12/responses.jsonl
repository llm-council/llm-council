We need to identify the term that describes this characteristic of services.\n\n**Key Concept:**\nIn service marketing, services have unique characteristics that distinguish them from physical goods. One of these characteristics is the inability to store services for future sale or use. This means that if a service opportunity isn't utilized at the moment it's available, it's lost forever.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n- **A: Immeasurability** - Refers to something that cannot be measured.

Not applicable.\n- **D: Non-storability** - Means the service cannot be stored. Relevant to the context.\n- **E: Indivisibility** - Suggests services cannot be divided into parts. Not directly related.\n- **F: Perishability** - Describes services that cannot be stored for later use or sale.\n- **G: Non-recoverability** - Implies the service opportunity can't be recovered once lost.\n- **H: Inseparability** - Means services are produced and consumed simultaneously.\n- **I: Heterogeneity** - Indicates variability in service quality.\n- **J: Intangibility** - Refers to services that cannot be touched or seen before purchase.\n\n**Decision Point:**\nBoth **D: Non-storability** and **F: Perishability** are closely related and relevant.
