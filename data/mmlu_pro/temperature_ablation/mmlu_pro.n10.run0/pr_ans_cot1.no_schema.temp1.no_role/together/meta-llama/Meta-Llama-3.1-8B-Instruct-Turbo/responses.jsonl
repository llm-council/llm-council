They often focus on safety, avoiding harm, and not causing unnecessary distress.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n- Options C, H, G, and D contain the word \"Safe practices\", which implies the advertising bodies regulate advertisements to maintain safety. option H is the one about unsafe practices.\n- Option I contains \"Distress\" and \"Fear\", which fits well with advertisements needing to avoid causing unnecessary distress.\n- Options D, G, F, and E contain \"Serious\" which does not fit with typically regulatory fears (those ads needing advertisement regulatory control often avoid making the viewer feel low heartbeat, or extremely scared).\n- Option F suggests jealousy as the undesirable emotion, but in advertisement regulatory body case, unsafe practice and causing the viewer fears are much more valid option assessment (there is ample historical precedent on the advertising fears you cannot use advertisement pricing or debris you must watch low prices priceless against
