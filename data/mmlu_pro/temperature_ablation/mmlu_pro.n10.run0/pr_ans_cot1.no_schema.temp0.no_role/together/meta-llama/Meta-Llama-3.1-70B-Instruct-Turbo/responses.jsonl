Prohibition on transactions: Islamic finance prohibits transactions that involve \"uncertainty\" (gharar) and \"speculation\" (maysir). These types of transactions are seen as unfair and potentially exploitative.\n\n3. Prohibition of sinful investment: Islamic finance prohibits investment in activities that are considered sinful or haram, such as gambling, alcohol, or pork production.\n\n4.
