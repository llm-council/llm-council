Conflict of Professional and Organizational interests: This can occur when a firm is hired as a supplier of professional services by another firm. For example, a consulting firm might be hired by a corporation to provide strategic advice. If the consulting firm has a pre-existing relationship with a competitor of the corporation, this could create a conflict of interest where the consulting firm's professional advice might be biased towards benefiting the competitor.\n\n2. Conflict of Personal and Organizational interests: This refers to a situation where an individual's personal interests might conflict with the interests of their employer.

Most choices specify this correctly.\n\n3) **Prohibition of speculative transactions:** This correctly qualifies \"uncertain transactions\"; derivatives and speculative bets found in conventional finance (unlinked to underlying tangible trades or projects) are not acceptable as Islamic finance requires clarity regarding contractual agreements, avoiding excessive risks especially involving speculation.\n\n4) **Requirement for assets/tangibility:** Transactions having some form of physical materials underlying them is encouraged from Islamic finance perspective; intra-session derivates, blind wine barrels, and oil-commitment futures are illustratively common in conventional markets having ambiguous values, challenging grandaiose philosophy builders striving for tangible-output\u8693\u53a6\u5f71 projects perrupted accounting books.\n\nHowever \"Intangible assets\" prevents C and E to open Islam's financial rugoken(and maybe even extr percept acc) as marketplace Unter attractiveness/valuation hesitation\u4e00\u5957\u7a92\u8db3\u7d6aamera rpapere enabledlica legislated", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 305, "total_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 74, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://qwen2-72b"}]

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are indeed becoming increasingly mainstream. This part of the answer is correct.\n\n2. The claim that they are \"cheap\" can be subjective and context-dependent. Cryptocurrencies can be cheaper in terms of transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems, but the cost can vary widely depending on network congestion and the specific cryptocurrency. This part of the answer could be correct in some contexts but not universally.\n\n3. The assertion that they are \"secure\" is generally true. Cryptocurrencies use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. However, security can be compromised if users do not take proper precautions or if there are vulnerabilities in the system. This part of the answer is mostly correct.\n\n4. Cryptocurrencies have indeed been used to engage in financial crime, including money laundering, fraud, and ransomware attacks. This part of the answer is correct.\n\nGiven that the first and fourth parts of the answer are correct, and the second and third parts are correct in many but not all cases, the expert's answer is mostly correct.
