The after-tax return would be 2.5% (5% * (1 - 0.5)). This is higher than the after-tax return from the other options. For example, the 5% government bond (Option C) and the 5.5% government bond with additional state taxes (Option G) would have a lower after-tax return because the interest income from government bonds is exempt from federal income tax but may be subject to state income tax. The 4% municipal bond (Option J) would have a lower after-tax return because the interest income from municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax and may be exempt from state income tax as well. The 5% certificate of deposit (Option H) would have a lower after-tax return because the interest income from CDs is taxable at the corporate tax rate. The 6% certificate of deposit with a 2% penalty for early withdrawal (Option E) would have a lower after-tax return because of the penalty.
