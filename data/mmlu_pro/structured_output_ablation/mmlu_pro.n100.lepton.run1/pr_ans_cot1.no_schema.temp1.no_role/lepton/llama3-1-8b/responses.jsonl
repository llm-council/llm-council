Therefore, Mrs. Bracken's filing status is (B) Qualifying widow(er).\n\n(b) As a qualifying widow(er), Mrs. Bracken is allowed a larger number of exemptions, which would be the exemptions she and her spouse were entitled to if they were still filing jointly.

Translation equivalence: This is similar to functional equivalence, focusing on the translation of words, phrases, and sentences in a way that maintains the original meaning.\n\nC.
