Power culture - This type of culture is characterized by centralization of power and authority, which might not directly imply stability and efficiency but can result in quick decision-making.\n\nB. Clan culture - Clan culture emphasizes teamwork and collaboration, similar to a family. It is focused on the internal environment and on employees, which can contribute to stability but might not be as efficient due to potential slower decision-making.\n\nC. Network culture - This is a flexible culture that allows for adaptation and innovation but does not inherently focus on stability and efficiency.\n\nD. Role culture - This culture emphasizes structure, rules, and roles, which typically leads to high levels of stability and efficiency as processes are well-defined.\n\nE. Task culture - Focused on the achievement of tasks, this culture might offer some level of efficiency but isn't necessarily as stable since it's driven by the tasks at hand rather than established processes.\n\nF.
