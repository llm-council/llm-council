This specialisation allows employees to focus on specific aspects of the organisation's tasks and contribute their expertise towards achieving specific goals.\n\nWhile other organisational structures (such as matrix, network, or divisional structures) may also involve some degree of specialisation, the functional structure is arguably the most pronounced example. In a functional structure, employees are typically assigned specific roles or responsibilities, with clear lines of authority, which facilitates specialisation as a core feature of this organisational structure.\n\nReasoning note: The hierarchal structure (option A) may involve a degree of specialisation to some extent, but its primary characteristic is the alignment of authority and decision-making.
