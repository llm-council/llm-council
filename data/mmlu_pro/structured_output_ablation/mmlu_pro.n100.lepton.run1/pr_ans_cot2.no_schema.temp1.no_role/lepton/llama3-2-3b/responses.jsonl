In this context, EOM stands for \"end of the month\". EOM is a standard notational convention used to identify the end of the fiscal month. The fraction \"/10\" indicates a time frame of 10 days from the end of the month. Therefore, it means that if a payment is made within 10 days after the end of the month, the customer may deduct 7% of the invoice amount from the total amount owed, resulting in a discounted invoice amount.", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 471, "completion_tokens": 126}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 462, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]

On the other hand, Company B's strong sales and weak administration make it a poor match.\n* Condition (b) is met when Company X has a strong sales force but a weak administration. Company B's strong sales force is a good match, but its weak administration is a concern. Company A's weak sales force is not a good match.\n* Condition (c) is met when Company X is looking for short-term improvement in its profits. Both companies have made significant profits in the past, but Company B's higher net income suggests that it has a more profitable business model.
