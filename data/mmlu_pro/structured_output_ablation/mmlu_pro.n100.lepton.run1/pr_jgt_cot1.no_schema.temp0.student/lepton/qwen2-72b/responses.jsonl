They are described as \"cheap\" and \"secure.\" While cryptocurrencies can be cheaper in terms of transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems, the security aspect can be debated. Cryptocurrencies can be secure in the sense that transactions are recorded on a blockchain, which is difficult to alter.
