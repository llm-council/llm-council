Specialisation is a key feature of functional organisational structures, as employees are expected to be experts in their specific function and work together to achieve organisational goals.\n\nIn a functional organisational structure, employees are often generalists who may work on multiple projects and tasks, but they are still expected to have a broad range of skills and knowledge. This allows for flexibility and adaptability, as employees can be called upon to work on different projects and tasks as needed.\n\nIn contrast, other organisational structures, such as hierarchical, network, and matrix structures, may also involve specialisation, but it is not as central to their design as it is in functional structures. For example, in a hierarchical structure, specialisation may be limited to specific departments or teams, while in a network structure, specialisation may be more focused on specific projects or clients. In a matrix structure, specialisation may be more focused on specific tasks or functions, but it is often balanced with a more generalist approach to ensure that employees can adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 428, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 442, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]

Utilitarianism is a moral philosophy that argues that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. This is in line with the definition of utilitarianism, which was first proposed by Jeremy Bentham and later developed by John Stuart Mill. The core idea of utilitarianism is to maximize overall happiness or well-being, and to do so by considering the consequences of actions on the greatest number of people.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not accurately capture the essence of utilitarianism. Option B refers to a theory of distributive justice, which is a different concept from utilitarianism. Option C is actually a definition of consequentialism, which is a broader category of moral theories that focus on the consequences of actions. Option D is a definition of deontology, which is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of rules and duties. Option E is a definition of a form of consequentialism that prioritizes the interests of the majority, but it is not a definition of utilitarianism. Option F is a definition of a form of consequentialism that prioritizes the interests of the majority, but it is not a definition of utilitarianism.
