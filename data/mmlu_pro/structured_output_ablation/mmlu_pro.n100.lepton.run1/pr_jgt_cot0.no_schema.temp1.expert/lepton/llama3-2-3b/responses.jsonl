A clan culture is a type of organizational culture that is characterized by a strong sense of community, shared values, and a focus on long-term relationships. This type of culture is more likely to deliver stability and efficiency because it fosters a sense of belonging, cooperation, and commitment among employees.\n\nRole culture, on the other hand, is a type of organizational culture that emphasizes clear roles and responsibilities, but it may not necessarily promote a sense of community or long-term relationships. While role culture can lead to efficiency and stability in the short-term, it may not be as effective in the long-term, as it can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement among employees.\n\nTask culture, People culture, and Network culture are not typically associated with delivering stability and efficiency, and Power culture is not mentioned as a typical culture type in the options provided.", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 150, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens": 195}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 366, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
