However, none of the provided options exactly match this, but option H ('Minimal power, Significant contribution, Corporate social responsibility') is closer to the correct answer in terms of contribution and responsibility, although it incorrectly states 'Minimal power'. Option J ('Huge power, Major contribution, Business malpractice') is incorrect because it suggests that businesses make a major contribution through business malpractice, which is not accurate.\"}"}, "id": "call-sADyasoutk84fQ4mrQaLmj", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens": 151}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 360, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": "answer_then_reasoning", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://qwen2-72b"}]
