The underlying principles of the code include integrity, accountability, openness, and dependability. Acceptability is not a principle explicitly mentioned in the code. The code emphasizes the importance of boards being accountable for their performance and for the performance of the company, and for being transparent and open in their decision-making processes. It also emphasizes the importance of boards being able to adapt to changing circumstances and being able to demonstrate their integrity. Dependability is also a key principle, as boards are expected to be reliable and trustworthy. Acceptability, on the other hand, is not a principle that is explicitly mentioned in the code. Therefore, the expert is correct in identifying acceptability as not being one of the underlying principles of the corporate governance Combined Code of Practice.\"}"}, "id": "call-g37N3Wg6ehtZ636fKdcmig", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 156, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens": 178}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 193, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": "answer_then_reasoning", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-8b"}]
