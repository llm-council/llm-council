So, the answer should include \"Interest\".\n\n2. **Prohibition on Uncertain and Speculative transactions**: Islamic finance prohibits transactions that involve uncertainty (gharar) and speculation (maysir). This principle is aimed at ensuring fairness and transparency in financial dealings. Therefore, \"Uncertain\" and \"Speculative\" are correct inclusions.\n\n3. **Requirement for all financial products to be backed by Tangible assets**: In Islamic finance, financial products are typically required to be backed by tangible assets, ensuring that financial transactions are linked to real economic activities rather than mere speculation. This is in line with the prohibition of dealing in intangible assets without underlying real values.\n\nGiven these principles, the correct answer should match these criteria: Interest as the prohibited element, Uncertain and Speculative as the types of transactions prohibited, and Tangible assets as the requirement for backing financial products.\n\nThe student's answer was G: Interest, Unc", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 563, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 74, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-70b"}]

The equivalences are crucial when conducting research across different countries or cultures to ensure that the data collected is reliable and comparable.

It's about the utility and functionality of the offering in various cultural contexts.\n\n2. **Translation Equivalence**: This is about ensuring that the language used in research instruments (like surveys or questionnaires) has the same meaning in different languages. It involves careful translation to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n3. **Conceptual Equivalence**: This deals with whether the same concept means the same thing in different cultures. It's about the equivalence of ideas, beliefs, values, and norms across cultures.\n\nGiven these definitions, the student's answer is **D: Market equivalence.** This is because the three recognized types of equivalences in international market research are indeed Functional, Translation, and Conceptual equivalences. \"Market equivalence\" is not a standard term used in the context of ensuring comparability and validity in international market research.

The most well-known deontological theory is Immanuel Kant's theory, often associated with \"ethics of duty.\"\n\n2. **Consequentialist Theories**: These theories focus on the consequences of actions. The most well-known form is Utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize overall happiness or well-being. Egoism, another form of consequentialism, focuses on maximizing the happiness or well-being of the individual performing the action.\n\n3. **Ethics of Rights and Justice**: This refers to a set of principles that emphasize the rights of individuals and the distribution of justice within society. It can overlap with deontological ethics but is not strictly a type of consequentialist or deontological theory.\n\nGiven these definitions:\n\n- **Utilitarianism** and **Egoism** are examples of **Consequentialist** theories, not deontological or principle-based theories in the traditional sense of ethics of duty or rights and justice.\n\n- **Ethics of rights and justice", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 544, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 309, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-70b"}]
