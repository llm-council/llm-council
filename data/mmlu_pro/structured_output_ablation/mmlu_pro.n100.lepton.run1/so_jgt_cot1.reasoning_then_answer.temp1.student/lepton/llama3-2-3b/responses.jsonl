Utilitarianism holds that the moral rightness of an action is determined by the fact that it promotes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. It is not limited to just one person, but rather it is concerned with the overall happiness of the population as a whole. In the theory of Utilitarianism, actions are judged right if they lead to a maximum overall happiness or well-being for the most number of people, which includes the achievement of pleasure, well-being, or absence of suffering.\", \"answer\": \"A\"}"}, "id": "call-cTaxBSA5Th5nay3unNvk9z", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 374, "total_tokens": 540, "completion_tokens": 166}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 434, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": "reasoning_then_answer", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
