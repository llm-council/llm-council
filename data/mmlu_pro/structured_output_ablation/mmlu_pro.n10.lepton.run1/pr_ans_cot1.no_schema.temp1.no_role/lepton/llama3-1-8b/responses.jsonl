This means we are looking for options that mention either \"fear\" or \"distress\" in a context that suggests it's unnecessary or inappropriate.\n\n3. **Cause trivial offence**: The requirement is to avoid causing offense, but the term \"trivial\" might not align with the typical emphasis on avoiding harm or distress.\n\n4. **Serious offence**: Advertising must not cause serious offense.
