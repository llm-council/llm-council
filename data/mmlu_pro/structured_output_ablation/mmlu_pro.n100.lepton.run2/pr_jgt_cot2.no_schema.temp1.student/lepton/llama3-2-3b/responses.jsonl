A functional organisational structure organises an organisation around its major functions, such as sales, marketing, finance, and human resources. Each department or team within the organisation is responsible for a specific function, and employees in each department are generalists who can perform a range of tasks related to their function.\n\nSpecialisation, on the other hand, is more commonly associated with hierarchical, divisional, and matrix organisational structures. In these structures, employees are often assigned to specific teams or departments based on their expertise and the needs of the organisation. This allows for greater specialisation and a more effective use of employees' skills and abilities.\n\nIn a flat organisational structure (option D), employees may have more autonomy and responsibility, but specialisation is not necessarily a key feature. In a decentralized organisation (option E), decision-making authority is distributed across different levels and departments, but specialisation is also not a defining characteristic.\n\nTherefore, while specialisation can be a feature of some organisational structures, it is not typically a feature of a functional structure.", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens": 236}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 442, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
