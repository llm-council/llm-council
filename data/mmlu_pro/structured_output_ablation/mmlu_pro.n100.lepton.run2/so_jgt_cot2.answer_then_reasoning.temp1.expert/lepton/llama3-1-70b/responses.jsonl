This order is correct because it matches the order in which the strategies are typically used to justify or deny unethical behaviour. Denial of injury is used when actors believe their actions harm nobody, Appeal to higher loyalties is used when actors argue that their norm violation is an attempt to realize higher-order values, and Metaphor of the ledger is used when actors argue they are owed something. This order is consistent with the typical progression of justifications used by individuals who engage in unethical behaviour.\"}"}, "id": "call-bg4icfVxua5jsgAKSVFeJF", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 387, "total_tokens": 532, "completion_tokens": 145}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 261, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": "answer_then_reasoning", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-70b"}]
