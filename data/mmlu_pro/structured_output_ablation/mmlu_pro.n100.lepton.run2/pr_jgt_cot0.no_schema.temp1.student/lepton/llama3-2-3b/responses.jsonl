For instance, a law firm may provide services to a company that employs its own lawyers, potentially leading to conflicts of interest. The personal interest of the lawyers (e.g., retaining their jobs) may conflict with their professional obligations to provide unbiased and objective services.\n2. **Conflict of personal interests** and **conflict of organizational interests**: This type of conflict may arise when an individual's interests conflict with those of their employer.
