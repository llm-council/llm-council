This is a key characteristic of the \"gig economy,\" where short-term, flexible, often freelance work arrangements have become more common.\n\n2. **Benefit for Businesses**: The question mentions that this arrangement results in something beneficial for businesses. In the context of the gig economy, this benefit is often flexibility. Businesses can hire workers on a project basis without the long-term commitment of traditional employment, which can be more cost-effective and adaptable to changing business needs.\n\n3. **Issues for Those Employed**: The question highlights several issues for those employed in this manner, including increased risk, uncertainty, and a lack of social welfare structures. In the gig economy, workers often do not have access to the same benefits and job securities as those in traditional employment arrangements, leading to increased risk and uncertainty. They may also lack access to social welfare structures that are typically provided by employers in more traditional employment settings.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer should include the term \"gig economy,\" indicate that the", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 304, "total_tokens": 560, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 124, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-70b"}]

While specialisation might occur, it's not a defining feature.\n- Network: Involves partnering with other organisations to share resources. Specialisation might not be the primary focus.\n- Functional: Organised by department or function (e.g., marketing, finance). Specialisation is a key feature, as each department focuses on a specific area of expertise.\n- Flat: Has a minimal number of levels in its hierarchy. Specialisation is not necessarily a defining characteristic.\n- Decentralized: Decision-making authority is distributed. Specialisation might not be the primary focus.\n- Divisional: Organised by product or market, with each division having a high degree of autonomy.
