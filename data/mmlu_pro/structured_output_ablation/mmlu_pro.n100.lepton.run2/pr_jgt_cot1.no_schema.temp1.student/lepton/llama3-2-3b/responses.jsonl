However, the concept of \"emotional 'moral impulse' towards others\" doesn't directly align with the core tenets of postmodern ethics, which tends to emphasize critique over the identification of a central moral impulse.\n\n- Ethical egoism (A) holds that moral judgments are derived from self-interest. While egoism can be a focus of individual moral impulses, it doesn't necessarily convey the idea of locating morality beyond rationality in an \"emotional 'moral impulse' towards others.\"\n\n- Ethics of duty (B) emphasizes the importance of fulfilling moral obligations regardless of personal consequences. This could involve actions driven by emotional impulses, but it is more about the nature of those obligations than the emotional driving force behind them.\n\n- Consequentialist ethics (D) and Utilitarian ethics (E) focus on the outcomes of actions as the basis for moral judgment.
