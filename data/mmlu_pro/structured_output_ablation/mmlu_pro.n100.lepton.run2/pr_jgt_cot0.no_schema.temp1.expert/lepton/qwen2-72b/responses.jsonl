Corporate Social Responsibility speaks to companies' positive ethical influence on society, regardless of power.

Introducing Business Malpractice modifies that suddenly to the far opposite.\n\nOptions like I highlight this somewhat better: There can still be a significant major contribution through the concept and existence of Corporate Social Responsibility (which Business Malpractice qualifies out of instantly due to its liability issues) but not clearly harmful at the same breadth, contributing to a divisive lack of coherence in itself in 'J'.
