This strategy is often used when entering a new market or when trying to disrupt an existing market. By setting a low price, the company can attract a large number of customers and gain a significant market share before competitors have a chance to react. Once the company has established a strong market position, it can then increase prices or introduce higher-priced products or services. Penetration pricing is often used in industries where there are significant economies of scale, such as manufacturing or technology, where the cost of production decreases as the volume of production increases. By gaining a large market share quickly, the company can achieve lower costs and higher profits in the long run. However, penetration pricing can also be risky, as it may lead to price wars with competitors or may not be sustainable in the long run if the company is unable to maintain low costs or differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors. In addition, penetration pricing may not be effective in markets where customers are not price-sensitive or where there are significant barriers to entry.
