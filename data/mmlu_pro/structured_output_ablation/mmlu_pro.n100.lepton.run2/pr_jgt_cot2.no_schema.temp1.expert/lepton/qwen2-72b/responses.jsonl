The expert is wrong. \n\nThe correct answer to the question should be as follows: prohibition of charging and paying Interest, prohibition on Uncertain and Speculative transactions, and all financial products must be backed by tangible assets. \n\nIslamic finance prohibits the earning or payment of interest ('riba') because it conflicts with the principles of Islamic law (Sharia), which discourage exploitative gain and promote fair transactions and wealth distribution. Additionally, Islamic finance avoids speculative investments and uncertain transactions ('gharar') to reduce potential harm and ensure that trade is based on real and tangible assets. Therefore, the correct answer should state that financial products must be backed by tangible assets because in Islamic finance, any financial transaction must have a valid underlying asset or commodity associated with it. This is why derivative products, which are associated with uncertainty and speculation, are generally not allowed.\n\nIn conclusion, the given answer (G: Interest, Uncertain, Speculative, Tangible assets) is incorrect because all financial products in Islamic finance must be backed by tangible assets, not just in speculative transactions.

Perishability is a characteristic of services that refers to the fact that they cannot be stored for later use or sale. Once a service opportunity is missed, it is gone forever. This is why a seat on a train, an airplane, or in a movie theater that goes unsold when the service is provided cannot be recovered or sold at a later time. The service opportunity has \"perished.\" This concept is fundamental in service management and economics, particularly in industries where capacity is fixed and demand can be variable.", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens": 128}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 79, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://qwen2-72b"}]
