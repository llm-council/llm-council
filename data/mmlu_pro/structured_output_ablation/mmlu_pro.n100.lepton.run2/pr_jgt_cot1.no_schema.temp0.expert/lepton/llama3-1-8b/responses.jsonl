The term \"(7/10)\" is a fraction, where 7 is the numerator and 10 is the denominator. This fraction can be interpreted as a percentage, where 7 is the percentage and 10 is the base.\n3. To convert the fraction to a percentage, divide the numerator by the denominator: 7 \u00f7 10 = 0.7. To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.7 \u00d7 100 = 70%.\n4.
