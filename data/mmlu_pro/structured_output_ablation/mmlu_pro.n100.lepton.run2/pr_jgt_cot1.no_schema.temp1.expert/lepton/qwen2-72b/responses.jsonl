Whether a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is considered expensive or cheap depends on relative terms. Generally, purchasing, holding, or converting cryptocurrencies might have costs; there are also gas fees that can be substantial depending on the network traffic. Further, they may also appeal in terms of their exchange values, which are subject to market forces. In principle, transactions might cost fewer fees than bank transactions making them seem \"cheap.\"\n\nOptions A, D, H discuss security.
