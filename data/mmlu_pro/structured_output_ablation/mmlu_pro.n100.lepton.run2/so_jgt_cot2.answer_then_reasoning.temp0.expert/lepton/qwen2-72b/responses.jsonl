Collaboration encourages open communication and the sharing of ideas, which can lead to a more positive attitude towards change. The other culture types listed may not necessarily promote the same level of acceptance of change. For example, a hierarchical culture (B) may resist change due to a strict adherence to established procedures and a power culture (C) may prioritize stability over change. A competitive culture (D) may focus on individual success over team success, which could also hinder the acceptance of change. An individualistic culture (F) may prioritize personal goals over organizational goals, which could also lead to resistance to change. A task culture (G) may be more focused on completing specific tasks than on organizational change. Therefore, the expert's answer of E: Collaborative culture is correct.\"}"}, "id": "call-mDudMyakSRx3v2jZKpDYre", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 159, "total_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens": 230}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 134, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": "answer_then_reasoning", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://qwen2-72b"}]
