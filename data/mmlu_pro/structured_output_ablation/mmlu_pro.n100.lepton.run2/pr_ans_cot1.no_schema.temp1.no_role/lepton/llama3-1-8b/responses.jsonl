So, our first key point aligns with options that mention interest.\n\n2. **Prohibition on Uncertain and Speculative Transactions:** Islamic finance emphasizes transactions that are secure, certain, and have lower risks. It discourages or prohibits speculative activities, advocating for transactions that are obviously legal and have an expiration date. Therefore, a key difference includes a focus on transactions that are at least uncertain (or broadly applicable) rather than speculative transactions.\n\n3. **Backed by Both Tangible and Intangible Assets:** Islamic finance requires financial transactions to be backed by identifiable, tangible assets (with an underlying physical or legal capital), and not merely upon abstract or speculative claims as are common in conventional finance's derivative products.\n\nConsidering the principles outlined:\n\n- We know that charging and paying interest is a significant divergence from conventional finance, represented in options A, G, and J.
