This does not necessarily imply that one has a moral duty to deal with these stakeholders, rather, it's about securing the support that is considered to be a prerequisite to survival.\n- The Descriptive stakeholder type encompasses all stakeholders whose interests an enterprise is actually dependent upon or involved with. These stakeholders possess information, capabilities, perspectives, or other forms of goodwill which are vital to business survival.\n- The Instrumental stakeholder type exists for those stakeholders whose impact or influence an enterprise prefers or seeks. These preferences could be because they further an enterprise's long-term purposes, or because they offer themselves advantages that benefit the stakeholders, or because they contribute important societal benefits that can\u2019t be captured in market measurement or other mechanisms.\n\nHence, Donaldson and Preston (1995) offer a theory of different kinds of stakeholders and these embody all the possible ways (Normative, Descriptive and Instrumental) these categories can be expressed.\n\nTherefore,", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 166, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 190, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
