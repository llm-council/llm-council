The term 'cheap' is relative here as it refers to transaction costs being lower compared to traditional banking systems, not necessarily the value of the cryptocurrency. The term 'secure' refers to the technology (blockchain) underlying cryptocurrencies that makes transactions less prone to hacking or fraud. Options E and I also seem fitting but are less accurate due to the term 'expensive,' which is not commonly associated with cryptocurrencies regarding transaction fees.

However, it raises the risk for the employed, as they are confronted with uncertainty and instability, potentially leading to a lack of social welfare structures like pension schemes, health insurance benefits, etc. Autonomy, while often a perceived upside, is not in every case a downside, so B which also includes autonomy isn\u2019t the best answer. Social welfare structures are an opposing factor to the Gig model and therefore are likely seen as lacking in a pure Gig Economy.

Risk is a downside, while Autonomy could be perceived as neutral or positive, depending on the individual.
