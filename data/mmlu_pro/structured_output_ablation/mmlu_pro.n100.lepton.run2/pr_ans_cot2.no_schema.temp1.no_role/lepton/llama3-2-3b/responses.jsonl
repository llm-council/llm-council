Two key restrictions are:\n\n* Prohibition on charging and paying interest (riba). This means that financial transactions should not involve any expectation of interest or return beyond the principal amount.\n* Prohibition on uncertain transactions, which are seen as insuring against risk without proper returns. This means that conventional insurance models, which provide premiums in exchange for a chance to win a larger amount, are not allowed.\n\nIn contrast, certain transactions are encouraged in Islamic finance, such as risk-sharing (mudaraba) and partnership (muallaqat). For Islamic financial products to be Shariah-compliant, they must be backed by a certain level of assurance or guarantee. This is where tangible assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, are used to ensure that the financial product is liquid and secure.\n\nTherefore, option D (Interest, Certain, Assured, Tangible assets) accurately describes key differences between Islamic finance and conventional finance.", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens": 221}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 74, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
