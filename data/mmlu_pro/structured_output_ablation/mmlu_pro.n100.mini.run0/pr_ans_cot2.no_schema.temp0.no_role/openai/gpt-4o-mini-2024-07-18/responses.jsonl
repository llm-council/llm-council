In this case, acquiring Company A would be beneficial because Company A has lower sales but a manageable size, allowing Company X's strong administration to potentially improve its operations and sales.\n\n2. **Condition (b)**: Company X has a strong sales force but weak administration. Here, acquiring Company B would be more advantageous. Company B has higher sales and gross profit, which could be leveraged by Company X's strong sales force, even if the administration is weak.\n\n3. **Condition (c)**: Company X is looking for short-term improvement in its profits. Company B has a significantly higher net income ($272,000) compared to Company A ($96,000). Therefore, acquiring Company B would provide a more immediate boost to profits.\n\nGiven these analyses, the best choice for Company X is to acquire Company B in both conditions (b) and (c), while Company A may be more suitable in condition (a).
