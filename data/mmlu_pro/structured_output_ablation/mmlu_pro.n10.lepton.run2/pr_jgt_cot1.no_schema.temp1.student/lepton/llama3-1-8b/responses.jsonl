Prohibition of charging and paying interest: This is a fundamental difference between Islamic finance and conventional finance. Islamic finance prohibits the collection and payment of interest (Riba), which is considered exploitative and unjust. Therefore, option A (Interest) is correct.\n\n2. Prohibition on uncertain and speculative transactions: Islamic finance prohibits transactions that involve uncertainty or speculation, such as gambling or insurance. These types of transactions are considered haram (forbidden) in Islam. The correct term here is \"uncertain\" rather than \"certain,\" as Islamic finance encourages transactions to be based on certainty rather than speculation. Therefore, option E (Interest, Uncertain, Assured, Intangible assets) is incorrect, and the correct answer is likely related to \"uncertain\" and \"speculative\" transactions.\n\n3. Prohibition of sinful investment: Islamic finance prohibits investments in activities that are considered sinful or haram, such as the production of liquor or pork.
