According to the options provided, the correct answer should relate to the study of bureaucracy and its effects on workers.\n\nOption F: Weber is known for his work on bureaucracy, where he described its characteristics and effects on society, but the question specifically asks about the reaction of workers.\n\nAlvin Gouldner (H) did study bureaucracy, particularly in his work \"Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy\" (1954), where he examined the tension between bureaucracy and democracy. However, his work is not the most directly associated with the reaction of workers to bureaucracy in the context provided.\n\nOption I: Merton might seem relevant because he extended Weber's work on bureaucracy and discussed its dysfunctions, but again, he's not the most direct match for the question as phrased.\n\nWeber (F) describes bureaucracy, but the reaction of workers is more commonly associated with the work of Karl Marx (A). Marx was deeply concerned with how workers reacted to various aspects of capitalist systems, including bureaucracies within industries. His work frequently highlighted the alienation and reactions of workers to conditions of labor, which are often bureaucratic in nature.\n\nGiven the options", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 316, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-70b"}]
