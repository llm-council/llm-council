Large organizations may have more stringent procurement processes and potentially more substantial, more complex needs compared to small businesses.\n\n- **Industry Type**: Different industries might have unique needs or use-cases for products and services. For example, what is relevant and essential to a manufacturing company may significantly differ from what is valued by a service-based enterprise.\n\n- **Geographical Location**: The geographical presence of a business can profoundly affect its operational, compliance, and purchasing needs.
