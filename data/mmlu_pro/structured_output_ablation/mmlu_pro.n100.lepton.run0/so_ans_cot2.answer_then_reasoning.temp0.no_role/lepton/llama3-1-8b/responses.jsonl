Divisional structure is a type of organisational structure where the organisation is divided into separate divisions based on products, geographic locations, or other factors. Each division operates as a separate business unit, with its own management and resources. This structure allows for specialisation, as each division can focus on a specific area of the business, and can make decisions and take actions independently.\"}"}, "id": "call-BFc8KzeWHKPD7sdLi383zJ", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 104, "total_tokens": 203, "completion_tokens": 99}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 442, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": "answer_then_reasoning", "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-8b"}]
