In this scenario, Company X would benefit from acquiring a company with strong sales to compensate for its weakness. Company A has $3,000,000 in sales, while Company B has $5,000,000. However, the question isn't just about sales but also about the overall fit, including administrative capabilities to support those sales. Given Company X's strong administration, it could potentially leverage Company A's simpler structure more effectively than Company B's larger and possibly more complex operations. Thus, acquiring Company A might be more beneficial as it allows X to manage and potentially improve A's sales with its strong administration.\n\n(b) X has a strong sales force but a weak administration. Here, Company X needs a company with a solid administrative foundation to support its sales force. Company B, with its larger size and higher net income, suggests a more substantial administrative structure. Acquiring Company B would provide X with the administrative backbone it lacks, better supporting its strong sales force.\n\n(c) X is looking for short-term improvement in its profits.

Planning is the foundation of the management process, as it provides direction and guidance for the other functions.\n2. **Organising**: After planning, managers must allocate resources, assign tasks, and establish a structure to support the achievement of the planned objectives. Organising involves creating a framework for action.\n3. **Leading**: With a plan and organisation in place, managers must motivate and direct their team members to work towards the objectives. Leading involves influencing and guiding others to achieve the desired outcomes.\n4. **Controlling**: Finally, managers must monitor and evaluate the progress towards the objectives, identifying any deviations or issues that need to be addressed.
