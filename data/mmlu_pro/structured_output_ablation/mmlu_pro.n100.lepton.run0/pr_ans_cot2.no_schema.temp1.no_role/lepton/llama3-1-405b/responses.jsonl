This is because bonds represent debt, and debt takes precedence over equity. When you buy a bond, you essentially lend money to the company with the promise of regular interest payments and the return of your principal investment. Thus, in the event of bankruptcy, the company must prioritize repaying this debt to its bondholders first.\n\n2. **Preferred stockholders** come next. Preferred stock is a class of stock that is positioned between debt and common stock in the event of a claim. It typically represents a form of equity ownership but comes with a higher claim on assets and dividends compared to common stock. However, its claim is inferior to that of bondholders.\n\n3. **Common stockholders** are last in the line of claimants in a bankruptcy. Common stock represents a basic share of a corporation and grants its owner claim to part of its profit (if any), including the potential to receive parts of its assets if it's dissolved.
