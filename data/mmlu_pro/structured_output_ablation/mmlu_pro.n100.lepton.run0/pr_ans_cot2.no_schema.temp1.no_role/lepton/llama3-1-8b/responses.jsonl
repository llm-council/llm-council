It takes into account the urgency or time-sensitivity of the stakeholder's claim.\n\nThe **salience** of a stakeholder refers to the combination of legitimacy, power, and urgency that makes a stakeholder's claim relevant or impactful to the organisation.

Given that X has a strong administration but weak sales, it makes sense to acquire Company A, which has weaker sales ($3,000,000) compared to Company B ($5,000,000). By acquiring Company A, X's strong administration can potentially turn around Company A's weaker sales.\n\n(b) X has a strong sales force but a weak administration. In this case, X should acquire Company B, which has stronger sales ($5,000,000) compared to Company A ($3,000,000). However, with a weak administration, Company X may struggle to make the most of Company B's strong sales.\n\n(c) X is looking for short-term improvement in its profits. Based on last year's data, Company B has a higher gross profit margin (15%) compared to Company A (10%). Additionally, Company B's net income is higher ($272,000) compared to Company A ($96,000). Therefore, acquiring Company B would likely lead to a short-term improvement in profits for Company X.\n\nFor all three conditions, option J (Company B, Company B, Company A) is the most fitting answer.
