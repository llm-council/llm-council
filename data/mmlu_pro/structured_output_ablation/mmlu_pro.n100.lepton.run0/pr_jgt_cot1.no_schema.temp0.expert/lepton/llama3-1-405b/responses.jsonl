It makes sense that planning comes first because it lays the groundwork for all other functions.\n\n2. **Organising**: After planning, managers need to organize the resources (human, material, etc.) to execute the plan. This involves structuring the organization, delegating tasks, and establishing communication channels. Organizing logically follows planning because it prepares the organization to carry out the plan.\n\n3. **Leading**: With the plan in place and the organization structured, the next step is leading. This involves motivating employees, guiding them towards achieving the set goals, and making decisions that support the organization's objectives. Leading follows organizing because once the structure is set, managers need to direct and motivate the team.\n\n4. **Controlling**: Finally, controlling involves monitoring the organization's performance, identifying deviations from the plan, and taking corrective actions.

Therefore, options that mention \"cryptocurrencies\" are more likely to be correct.\n\n2. **Characteristics**: The question states that these currencies are becoming mainstream and have associated ethical implications, including being \"cheap\" and \"more secure.\" \n   - **Cheap**: This characteristic aligns with the fact that transaction fees for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are often lower compared to traditional banking and financial systems, especially for international transactions.\n   - **Secure**: Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which is considered secure due to its decentralized, cryptographic nature. This makes transactions transparent and difficult to tamper with.\n\n3. **Usage**: The question mentions that these currencies have been used to engage in \"financial crime.\" It's well-documented that cryptocurrencies, due to their pseudo-anonymous nature, have been used for illicit activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, and ransomware attacks.\n\nGiven these considerations, the expert's answer (A: Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime) aligns with the known characteristics and uses of", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 557, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 123, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-405b"}]

This clarity can lead to discipline and stability within the organization (B), a clear chain of command (D), and clear responsibilities and roles (A). Hierarchical structures also typically offer promotion opportunities (E) as employees can move up the ranks, and they can be easier to manage (G) due to the clear lines of authority and decision-making processes. However, these structures are often criticized for their lack of flexibility and slow response to change.\n\nThe reason for this slow response is largely due to the bureaucratic nature of decision-making in hierarchical structures. Decisions usually need to go through several layers of approval, which can delay the organization's ability to adapt quickly to changes in the market or other external factors. This contrasts with flatter organizational structures, which are often more agile and capable of responding to change more rapidly.\n\nGiven this analysis, \"Quick response to change\" (C) is indeed not an advantage typically associated with hierarchical structures.

When a company goes bankrupt, the first priority is to pay off its creditors, which includes bondholders. This is because bonds are essentially loans to the company, and the company has a contractual obligation to repay these loans with interest.\n\n2. **Preferred Stockholders**: They have a higher claim on assets and dividends than common stockholders. Preferred stock typically comes with a guarantee of a fixed dividend payment, and in the event of bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are paid before common stockholders. However, they are paid after bondholders because preferred stock is a form of equity, not debt.\n\n3. **Common Stockholders**: They are the last to be paid in the event of bankruptcy. Common stockholders are essentially the owners of the company, and they bear the greatest risk.

It emphasizes communication and flexibility rather than strict specialization.\n\nC: Functional - In a functional structure, the organization is divided into departments based on functions or areas of expertise (like marketing, finance, operations). Each department specializes in its area, making this structure highly conducive to specialization.\n\nD: Flat - This structure has fewer levels of management, aiming to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency. While it can have specialized roles, its defining feature is the lack of hierarchical layers.\n\nE: Decentralized -", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 442, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-405b"}]

Ensuring functional equivalence is crucial for the success of a product in international markets.\n\n2. **Translation Equivalence**: This pertains to how accurately the language and meaning of research instruments, marketing materials, or product information are translated from one language to another. Achieving translation equivalence is essential to ensure that the intended message is conveyed correctly across different languages and cultures.\n\n3. **Conceptual Equivalence**: This involves ensuring that the concepts, constructs, or ideas being researched or marketed have the same meaning across different cultures. Conceptual equivalence is vital for the validity of international market research, as it ensures that what is being measured or communicated is understood similarly across cultures.\n\nGiven these definitions, let's examine the options:\n\n- **A: Functional Equivalence** is indeed one of the equivalences.\n- **B: Translation Equivalence** is also recognized as a type of equivalence.\n- **C: Conceptual Equivalence** is another acknowledged form of equivalence.\n- **D: Market Equivalence** is not", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 438, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-405b"}]
