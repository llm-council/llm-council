Civil society typically refers to the network of non-governmental organizations, charities, and community groups that operate independently of the government. In countries with authoritarian or restrictive governments, civil society is often less developed due to limited freedoms and restrictions on non-governmental organizations.\n\nRussia and China are examples of countries where civil society is less developed due to their authoritarian governments and restrictive policies. In contrast, Britain is a country with a well-established tradition of civil society and a strong network of non-governmental organizations, making it a suitable example of a country where civil society is more developed.", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens": 147}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 192, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-405b"}]

It is a theoretical framework that provides a way of thinking about or approaching a problem, and is often used to guide research or analysis.
