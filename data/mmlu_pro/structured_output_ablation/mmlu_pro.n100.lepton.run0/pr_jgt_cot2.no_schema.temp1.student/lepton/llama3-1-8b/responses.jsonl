In a linear cost function, fixed costs are represented as a constant, and variable costs are represented as the slope multiplied by the dependent variable (in this case, X, which probably represents the number of shoes manufactured). To choose the correct formula, the student needs to use the information provided. Let's recall the general equation for linear functions, which is typically of the form y = m * x + b.\n\nFixed costs are $1200, and variable costs per shoe are $1.50, so the part of the equation that arises from fixed costs is 1200 (with no variable link since they are fixed.)
