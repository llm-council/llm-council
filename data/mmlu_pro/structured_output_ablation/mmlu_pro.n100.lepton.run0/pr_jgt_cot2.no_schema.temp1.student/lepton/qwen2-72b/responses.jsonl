While it's true that the term 'transformational' leadership is often used to describe leaders who inspire and empower their followers to achieve more than they would have on their own, and in doing so, transform them into better people, the categorization can be subjective. Transformational leaders are also characterized by their ability to inspire significant change in their organization or society. Bill Clinton can be considered a transformational leader for his role in leading the United States during a period of economic prosperity, for his efforts to bridge racial divides, and for his role in international diplomacy. He implemented significant policy changes such as welfare reform, NAFTA, and the Northern Ireland peace process. Furthermore, his personal charisma and communication skills were key aspects of his leadership style. Thus, it would be more appropriate to categorize him as a transformational leader, not the one who couldn't be termed as such from the given list.\n\nNone of the leaders mentioned can be definitively described as not transformational because all of them have been recognized for their significant impact in transforming their societies or countries.
