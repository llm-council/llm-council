This means that financial contracts should be clear and transparent, with all terms and conditions explicitly stated.\n\n3. **Prohibition of sinful investment**: Islamic finance requires that investments should not be made in activities that are considered sinful or \"haram\" (forbidden) in Islam, such as gambling, alcohol, or weapons manufacturing.\n\n4. **Requirement for all financial products to be backed by tangible assets**: In Islamic finance, financial products should ideally be backed by tangible assets.
