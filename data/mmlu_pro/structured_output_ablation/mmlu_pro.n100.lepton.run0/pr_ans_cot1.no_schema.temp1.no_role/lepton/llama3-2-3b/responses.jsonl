While power cultures can drive stability by minimizing resistance, they typically create a less efficient culture, as decision-making and feedback mechanisms may be hampered by bureaucratic processes.\n\n- **Clan culture (B)**: A clan culture prioritizes shared values and working harmoniously as a team. These organisations often have strong leader-to-employee relationships. They tend to deliver both stability and efficiency as trust within the team enhances cohesion, productivity, and leads to a more stable environment by addressing issues promptly and achieving their goals through collaboration.\n\n- **Network culture (C)**: Network cultures are centered on associating with various social units, often focused on sustaining or enhancing a highly industrialized or globally produced piece of work.

In the context of company privacy, the term \"boundaryless\" is often used to describe the nature of corporations. \n\nThe phrase \"it is difficult to _________ due to the number of individuals involved\" implies that the correct verb should describe the act of enforcing or maintaining privacy in the face of a large number of people. Given this context, the correct answer is \"control\" since it makes sense to struggle with controlling or managing individual privacy when there are many individuals involved.\n\nFinally, the phrase \"much corporate activity takes place in ________\" suggests that the correct answer should describe where corporate activity typically occurs. In this case, \"private spaces\" is a suitable answer, as corporations often operate in private environments such as offices or backrooms.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence would read: \"The enforcement of company privacy is complex as corporations are somewhat boundaryless, as there are few clear barriers to define their limits, it is difficult to control information due to the number of individuals involved and much corporate activity takes place in private spaces.\"\n\nThe answer is D.", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens": 254}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 307, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]

Specialisation can occur in network structures, but it's not the most direct association.\n\nC: Functional - This structure is arranged around common tasks or functions. Within a functional structure, organisations often specialise employees according to their function or task, making it a natural fit for specialisation.\n\nD: Flat - Flat structures are relatively flat with fewer levels of management. While specialisation can still occur in flat structures, it's not the primary characteristic.\n\nE: Decentralized - This is a structure where decision-making authority is distributed throughout the organisation. Specialisation is not necessarily a feature of decentralised structures.\n\nF: Divisional - Divisional structures are designed around separate business units, and specialisation can occur across these units, but the structure itself isn't most directly associated with specialisation.\n\nG: Matrix - Matrix structures are complex, with multiple reports", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 107, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 442, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
