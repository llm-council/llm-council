This can include the structure of atoms, the theory of evolution, or the behavior of subatomic particles. The paradigm serves as a lens through which scientists view the world and understand the underlying principles.\n4. **Usage in philosophy**: In philosophical contexts, a paradigm can refer to a fundamental concept or assumption that underlies a particular philosophical theory or approach.

In other words, it concerns the ability of the respondent to understand and perform actions or tasks as they do in their native language or culture.\n\n3. **Conceptual equivalence** targets the understanding of the cultural and conceptual nuances of language. It ensures that survey questions and instruments are posed in a way that equally sampled populations in different cultures have the same understanding of those questions.\n\n4. Market equivalence, however, as a term, is more related to the equivalence across different markets in terms of product or service features.

Liabilities are debts or obligations that a company or individual owes to others. The difference between assets and liabilities is the net worth or equity of an entity.\n\nThe term that describes the difference between assets and liabilities is \"net worth,\" which is the value of an entity's assets minus its liabilities. This makes sense because net worth measures the amount of ownership value in a business or an individual's financial situation, essentially the amount of funds that would be left if all debts were paid and all assets were sold.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Balance sum: This isn't a standard term to describe the difference between assets and liabilities.\n\nB. Debt: This is an example of a liability.\n\nC. Expenses: Expenses are costs incurred by an entity, but they do not describe the difference between assets and liabilities.\n\nD. Net worth: As described above, this term accurately describes the difference between assets and liabilities.\n\nE.
