This arrangement enables companies to adjust more easily to changes in market demand without the burden of having to maintain a large full-time workforce.\n\n3. **Challenges for Employees**: Employees in the gig economy often face increased uncertainty, as they do not have a steady income.

In this case, it would be beneficial to acquire a company with a strong sales record, since its own weakness is in sales. Between Company A and Company B, Company B has a significantly higher sales record. Therefore, under condition (a), Company X should acquire Company B.\n\n(b) Company X has a strong sales force but a weak administration. Here, it would make more sense for Company X to acquire a company with better financial management or profit margins to complement its sales strength. Given that Company A has higher profit margins relative to its size and sales compared to Company B, it might initially seem like the better choice for improving profitability through better financial management. However, one could argue that since Company B has a larger scale, its absolute profit is higher, and Company X might benefit from the increased operational efficiency and profit that B brings, even if not as high a margin. But considering the specific improvement needed (administration), a closer look at profit margin might suggest A is not the clear winner based solely on this criterion.
