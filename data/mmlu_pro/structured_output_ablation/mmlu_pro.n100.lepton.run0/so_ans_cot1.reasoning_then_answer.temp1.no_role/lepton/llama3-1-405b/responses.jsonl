C: Price skimming is the opposite of what we're looking for, as it involves setting prices high relative to competition. D: Value added pricing is about pricing based on the perceived value added to the product, not directly about market share. E: Penetration pricing is about setting the price low to gain market share, which matches our scenario. F: Premium pricing is about setting prices high to reflect a product's high quality or uniqueness, not our case. G: Cost-plus pricing involves pricing based on the cost of production plus a markup, not directly related to market share. H: Economy pricing is about setting prices low to attract price-sensitive customers but doesn't specifically aim to gain market share by undercutting competition.
