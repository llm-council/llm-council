In programed decisions, problems will be routine, recurrent problems, and structured with rule-based solutions. Aka: Structured. Time horizon: short-range with a low degree of sophistication. Programmed decisions enable organizations to create consistent operating procedures and streamline repetitive jobs. Programmed decisions improve efficiency and standardization with low risk. Routine ensures that the response will tend to be quick. Policies, rules, standards can be used as preplans.
