The quality and characteristics of a service can be highly variable.\n\n4. **Inseparability**: Services are often inseparable from the provider. The service is provided by a person or a team, and the quality of the service is closely tied to the skills and attitudes of the provider.\n\n5. **Lack of ownership**: When a service is consumed, the consumer does not take ownership of anything tangible.
