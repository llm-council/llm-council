This clarity can lead to discipline and stability within the organization (B), a clear chain of command (D), and clear responsibilities and roles (A). Hierarchical structures also typically offer promotion opportunities (E) as employees can move up the ranks, and they can be easier to manage (G) due to the clear lines of authority and decision-making processes. However, these structures are often criticized for their lack of flexibility and slow response to change.\n\nThe reason for this slow response is largely due to the bureaucratic nature of decision-making in hierarchical structures. Decisions usually need to go through several layers of approval, which can delay the organization's ability to adapt quickly to changes in the market or other external factors. This contrasts with flatter organizational structures, which are often more agile and capable of quicker responses to change due to fewer layers of decision-making.\n\nGiven this analysis, \"Quick response to change\" (C) is indeed not an advantage typically associated with hierarchical structures.

Stakeholders with more power are considered more salient.\n2. **Legitimacy**: This pertains to whether the organization perceives the stakeholder's actions as desirable, proper, and appropriate. Stakeholders whose actions are seen as legitimate are more likely to be considered salient.\n3. **Urgency**: This is about the immediacy of attention the stakeholder's claims require. Stakeholders whose claims are urgent are more likely to be considered salient.\n\nGiven these definitions, the correct sequence to determine stakeholder **salience** should start with the attributes that contribute to salience, followed by salience itself.

It makes sense that planning comes first because it lays the groundwork for all other functions.\n\n2. **Organising**: After planning, managers need to organize the resources (human, material, etc.) to execute the plan. This involves structuring the organization, delegating tasks, and establishing communication channels. Organising logically follows planning because it prepares the organization to carry out the plan.\n\n3. **Leading**: With the plan in place and the organization structured, managers must motivate and direct employees to achieve the organization's goals. Leading involves influencing others to work towards the common goal. It follows organising because once the structure is set, the manager needs to inspire and guide the team.\n\n4. **Controlling**: Finally, managers must monitor and evaluate the organization's performance to ensure it is on track to meet its goals. Controlling involves measuring performance, identifying deviations from the plan, and taking corrective action.
