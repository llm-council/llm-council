These guidelines often focus on ensuring that advertisements do not promote harmful behaviors or create negative emotional responses in the audience.\n\n1. **Encourage**: Advertisements should not encourage unsafe practices. This is a common guideline to prevent promoting behaviors that could harm individuals or society.\n\n2. **Cause unnecessary**: Advertisements should not cause unnecessary distress. This aligns with the idea that ads should not evoke negative emotions that could lead to anxiety or discomfort.\n\n3. **Or**: The third blank likely refers to another negative emotional response that should be avoided in advertising. \"Fear\" is a common concern in advertising regulations, as ads should not manipulate audiences through fear tactics.\n\n4. **Must not cause**: Finally, advertisements should not cause serious offense.
