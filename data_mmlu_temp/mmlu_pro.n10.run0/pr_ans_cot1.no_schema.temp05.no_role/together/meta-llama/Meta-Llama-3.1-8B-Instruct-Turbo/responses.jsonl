Locating morality beyond the sphere of rationality\n2. An emotional 'moral impulse' towards others\n\nConsidering these points, we're looking for an ethical theory that emphasizes emotions and moral feelings over rationality.\n\n- Ethical egoism (A) focuses on individual self-interest, which doesn't necessarily involve an emotional 'moral impulse' towards others.\n- Ethics of duty (B) is based on a sense of obligation, but it's more about fulfilling duties than an emotional impulse.\n- Postmodern ethics (C) often emphasizes the complexity and diversity of human experiences, which might include emotional responses, but it's not directly focused on an emotional 'moral impulse'.\n- Consequentialist ethics (D) and Utilitarian ethics (E) focus on the outcomes of actions, which may involve emotions but are primarily concerned with rational calculation.\n- Deontological ethics (F) emphasizes the importance of duties and rules, which again is more about rational obligation than emotional impulse.\n- Virtue ethics (G) focuses on character development and moral virtues, which might involve emotions but is more about the cultivation of virtues than an emotional 'moral impulse'.\n- Ethics of care (H) is an approach that emphasizes empathy, care, and emotional connection with others, often prioritizing relationships and emotional responses over rational calculation.\n- Ethics of rights (I) focuses on the protection and respect of individual rights, which may involve emotional responses but is primarily concerned with rational principles.\n- Relativist ethics (J) emphasizes the diversity of moral perspectives and the need to respect different cultures and values, which might involve emotional responses but is more about tolerance and understanding than an emotional 'moral impulse'.\n\nConsidering these points, the best match is Ethics of care (H), as it emphasizes an emotional 'moral impulse' towards others and locates morality beyond the sphere of rationality.\n\nThe answer is H.", "tool_calls": []}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 160, "completion_tokens": 399, "total_tokens": 559}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 73, "temperature": 0.5, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "together://meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo"}]
