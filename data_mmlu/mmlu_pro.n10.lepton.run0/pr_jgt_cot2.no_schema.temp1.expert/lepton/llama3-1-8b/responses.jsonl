Downsizing is the process of reducing the workforce, often due to corporate restructuring or financial difficulties.

This is an issue of **involvement**, not autonomy.\n2. **Remuneration and compensation**: When employees are laid off, they typically receive a **severance package** that includes compensation for their lost wages, benefits, and other forms of support.
