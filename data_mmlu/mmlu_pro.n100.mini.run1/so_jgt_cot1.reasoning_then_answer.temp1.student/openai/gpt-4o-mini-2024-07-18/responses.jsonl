The prohibition of charging and paying __(1)__ : In Islamic finance, the charging and paying of 'interest' (riba) is prohibited. This part matches with 'Interest'. 2. Prohibition on __(2)__ and __(3)__ transactions: Islamic finance prohibits 'uncertain' (gharar) and 'speculative' (maysir) transactions as they involve excessive risk and uncertainty. These terms match with 'Uncertain' and 'Speculative' respectively. 3. Requirement for all financial products to be backed by __(4)__ : Islamic finance requires that all transactions are backed by tangible assets or services, making 'Tangible assets' relevant here. Thus, the first three segments of the student's answer are accurate; however, the requirement specifically mentions tangible assets and does not typically refer broadly to only 'Tangible assets' in this format, which makes the part ambiguous. Nonetheless, since the prohibition of interest, uncertainty, and speculation are accurately noted, we validate against tracking each term closely. Also, verifying the exact terms used in Islamic finance for these prohibitions. Hence, despite minor issues with specific phrasing, the critical components align with G. Therefore, while G may not specify the backing terms accurately, it captures the essential prohibitions well enough to recognize the answer as plausible.  However, the question demands specific wording in options that match the correct principles of Islamic finance. Given how the answer is analyzing and defaulting to what conventions fitted under Islamic finance specs versus conventional insights, even though the necessary conditions align contextually on a broader basis, the option of G should not fully be concluded as correct in strict semantic clarity. \\nTherefore, my conclusion is: B: the student is wrong, as G doesn't entirely conform to correct phrasing scopes expected in detailing of Islamic finance's principles.  \\n\",\"answer\":\"B\"}", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens": 417, "total_tokens": 770}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_507c9469a1"}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 74, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": "reasoning_then_answer", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "openai://gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"}]
