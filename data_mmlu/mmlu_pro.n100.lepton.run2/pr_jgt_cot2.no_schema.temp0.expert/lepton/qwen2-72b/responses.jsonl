The question is asking for a contrast between two types of theories or approaches to morality. Normative theory is indeed a code of conduct to which all rational beings should adhere. It deals with what ought to be, setting standards for behavior. Descriptive morality, on the other hand, is the code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society. It is an observation of what is, describing the moral beliefs and practices of a group without necessarily endorsing or condemning them.

The expert is correct.\n\nThe question asks which of the options would yield the greatest net return to a corporation in the 50% tax bracket. The key here is to understand that the tax implications of each investment type are different. Corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, and treasury bonds are all taxable at the federal level, whereas municipal bonds are typically exempt from federal income tax. Government bonds are also usually exempt from state and local taxes.\n\nGiven that the corporation is in the 50% tax bracket, we need to calculate the after-tax return of each option. For taxable investments, we would multiply the nominal return by (1 - tax rate). For tax-exempt investments like municipal bonds, the full nominal return is the after-tax return.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA) 4.5% treasury bond with lower liquidity: After-tax return = 4.5% * (1 - 0.5) = 2.25%\nB) 3.5% municipal bond with additional state taxes: After-tax return = 3.5% (assuming no state tax impact since the question specifies federal tax bracket)\nC) 5% government bond: After-tax return = 5% * (1 -", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 116, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://qwen2-72b"}]
