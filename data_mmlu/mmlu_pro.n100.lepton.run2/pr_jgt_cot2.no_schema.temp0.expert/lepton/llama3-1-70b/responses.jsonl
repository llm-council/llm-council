It can be a theoretical model, a conceptual framework, or an exemplary case that illustrates a particular concept or phenomenon.\n\nIn the context of Thomas Kuhn's influential book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\" a paradigm refers to a widely accepted theoretical framework or model that defines the legitimate problems and methods of a research field.
