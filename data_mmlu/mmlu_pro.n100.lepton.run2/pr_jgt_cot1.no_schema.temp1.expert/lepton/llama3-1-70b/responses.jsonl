Once this window passes (e.g., a train departs, a plane takes off, or a film screening ends), the opportunity to sell the product (e.g., a seat on the train, plane, or in the cinema) is irretrievably lost.\n\n2. **Defining the Concept**: The term that best describes this characteristic is \"perishability.\" In the context of services or products like those mentioned, perishability refers to the fact that these offerings cannot be stored or saved for later use or sale once their time-sensitive window has closed.

These theories often involve moral rules or duties that should be followed, and are typically associated with principles of right and wrong that are considered universal and absolute.\n\n3. **Relativist theories** propose that moral judgments are relative to the cultural, historical, or personal context.
