This definition aligns closely with the concept of Cognitive Dissonance, which is a theory that explains how people experience discomfort or tension when their behavior or attitudes conflict with their values or beliefs.\n\nCognitive Dissonance theory, developed by Leon Festinger, suggests that individuals strive for consistency between their thoughts, feelings, and actions. When a person's behavior or attitude conflicts with their values or beliefs, they experience dissonance, which motivates them to reduce the dissonance by changing their behavior, attitudes, or beliefs.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the principle described in the question:\n\n- Social Learning Theory (A) focuses on learning behaviors through observing and imitating others.\n- Contingency (B) and Operant Conditioning (C) are related to reinforcement and punishment, which do not directly address the role of values and beliefs in decision-making.\n- Evolutionary (D) and Classical (E) theories are related to the study of human behavior in the context of evolution and classical conditioning, respectively.\n- Expectancy", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 444, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 84, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
