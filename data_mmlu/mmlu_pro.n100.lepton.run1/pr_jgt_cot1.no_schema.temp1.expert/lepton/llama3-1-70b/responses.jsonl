Shareholders are typically seen as the owners of the company, while stakeholders include a broader group of individuals and organizations affected by the company's operations, such as employees, customers, suppliers, and the community.\n\n2. **Duties of Managers**: The question mentions two specific duties of managers: a duty to act for the benefit of the company and duties of care and skill, along with a third duty that is not clearly defined but is related to the management of the company's interests.\n\nGiven these points, let's examine the expert's answer, F: Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence.\n\n- **Shareholders**: This choice aligns with the traditional view in corporate governance that managers are primarily responsible to shareholders.

In Russia, there have been laws restricting the activities of NGOs, especially those receiving foreign funding. China has also tightened its grip on civil society, with laws that strictly regulate the operations of NGOs.\n   - **Britain**: The United Kingdom has a long history of a strong and active civil society.

Essentially, normative theory deals with prescriptions and values that guide moral decision-making and behavior, providing a standard for all rational beings to follow.\n\n2. **Descriptive Morality**: This is a form of ethics that aims to describe how people do behave morally, as opposed to prescribing how they ought to behave.
