A: Service product - This doesn't directly fit the description of being bought infrequently and requiring knowledge updates in the way the question implies.

Therefore, the correct interpretation of the term (7/10) EOM is that a customer may deduct 7% of the amount of the invoice if payment is made no later than the tenth day after the end of the month. This means that if the customer pays the invoice within 10 days after the end of the month, they can take a 7% discount on the total amount due. This type of payment term is often used to incentivize customers to pay their invoices quickly, as it provides a discount for early payment.\", \"answer\": \"A\"}"}, "id": "call-orLUkhoAXYbWGeL4TjCuE9", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 431, "total_tokens": 612, "completion_tokens": 181}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 462, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": "reasoning_then_answer", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-70b"}]
