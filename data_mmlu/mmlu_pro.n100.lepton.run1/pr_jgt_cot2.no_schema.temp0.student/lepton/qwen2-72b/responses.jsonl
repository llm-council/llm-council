The three types of equivalence in international market research are: conceptual equivalence, functional equivalence, and translation equivalence. Market equivalence is not one of these three. Conceptual equivalence refers to the adaptation of concepts to be culturally relevant and meaningful in different markets. Functional equivalence is about ensuring that the research methods and tools are appropriate and effective in different contexts.
