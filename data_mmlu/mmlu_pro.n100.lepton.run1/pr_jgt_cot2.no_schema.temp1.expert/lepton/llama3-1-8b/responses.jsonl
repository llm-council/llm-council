To assess the correctness of this conclusion, we need to analyze the given information.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can calculate the total labor cost as 20 operations * $5.00 per operation = $100.00, and the total material cost as 2 parts * $25.00 per part = $50.00. \n\nWe also know that there are no expenses listed. Therefore, the total production cost would be the sum of the labor cost and the material cost, which is $100.00 + $50.00 = $150.00.\n\nWe can also determine that labor represents 2/3 of the total production cost, while material costs represent 1/3 of the total production cost.\n\nWhile this suggests that labor costs are a significant fraction of the total production cost, it is not conclusive that output is labor intensive. \"Labor intensive\" is a subjective term that may depend on the context and the type of industry or production process.

The expert's answer, therefore, aligns with this understanding of democratic leadership.\n\nWhile other options may seem similar, such as a people-oriented (H) approach, which also emphasizes consideration for others, or a servant (B) approach, which prioritizes serving others, democratic leadership is specifically characterized by shared decision-making and the promotion of collective input. Task-oriented (A), transactional (C), and laissez-faire (D) approaches prioritize achieving goals, leveraging incentives or authority, and minimizing direction, respectively, which differ from the inclusive and consultative nature of democratic leadership.
