Expectancy theory is based on the idea that individuals make choices regarding how to behave based on their personal values and beliefs about what behavior will result in what outcomes.\n\nThe reasoning: Expectancy theory, suggested by Victor Vroom in 1964, postulates that whether a person behaves in a certain way is determined based on their perception of which outcomes they are expecting from taking the action. These expectations for different outcomes can be to different degrees depending on things like their motivation, therefore a person would choose based on what he/she regards to have the most satisfying outcome relative to the possible alternatives at that point. This pretty much defines making choices around their personal values and belief. None of the options given is an accurate match regarding this explanation besides F for Expectancy theory. These factors may in turn largely depend on various other predictive beliefs. To summarize choice and effort-to-performance Expectancy (expectation related to personal success), choice of behavior depends on high expectation (personal estimation of out-comes for a perceived course of action).

In the context of the train, aeroplane, or film, once the service (transportation or entertainment) has been provided, it cannot be retrieved or sold again.
