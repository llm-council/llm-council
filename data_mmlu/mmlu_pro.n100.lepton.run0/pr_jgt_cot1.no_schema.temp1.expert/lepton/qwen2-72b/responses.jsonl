Thus, it belongs in the liability section of the balance sheet. This is correct.\n\nB) Capital stock - Capital stock represents the share capital that has been issued by the company and subscribed by the shareholders. It is a component of the equity section of the balance sheet. This is correct.\n\nC) Retained earnings - Retained earnings are the cumulative net income that has been reinvested into the company rather than being distributed to shareholders as dividends. It is part of the equity section of the balance sheet. This is correct.\n\nD) Administrative expense - Administrative expenses are operating expenses that occur as a result of a company's normal day-to-day activities. They do not belong on the balance sheet but rather on the income statement. This is correct.\n\nE) Prepaid expenses - Prepaid expenses are expenses that have been paid in advance but are recognized as expenses over the period in which the services are consumed. Prepaid expenses are assets until they are consumed, after which they become expenses. Therefore, they belong on the asset side of the balance sheet.

In a 50% tax bracket, tax-sensitive investments can yield significantly different returns than their stated nominal rates.\n\nA. A 4.5% treasury bond with lower liquidity: Treasury bonds are federally tax-exempt. Assuming a 50% tax rate, a bond yielding 4.5% would have an effective yield of 4.5% (already factoring in the exemption), making it tax-effective regardless of the tax rate. However, lower liquidity affects the bond's flexibility in terms of being bought and sold.\n\nB. A 3.5% municipal bond with additional state taxes: Municipal bonds are typically exempt from federal tax. If state and local taxes are also waived for this bond, this nominal rate would be 100% after federal tax. If this was a 3.5% bond, that effective yield would remain if unaffected by state taxes or rebates.
