The political landscape has often been viewed as less supportive of civil society organizations (CSOs). After the fall of the Soviet Union, CSOs started to emerge more visibly, but they often struggle due to restrictive laws and policies. The Russian government has implemented laws that many argue are aimed at curbing the activities of civil society, such as laws labeling foreign-funded NGOs as \"foreign agents.\"\n\n2. **China** - Similar to Russia, the civil society in China faces unique challenges. The Chinese Communist Party's control over societal aspects is extensive, limiting the independent growth and impact of civil society organizations. Non-governmental organizations operate within a framework that prioritizes the state's ideology, which can restrict the kind of activities and advocacy work CSOs can engage in.\n\n3. **Britain**", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 509, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 192, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "expert"}, "llm": "lepton://qwen2-72b"}]

It is not dependent on the existence of any one person.
