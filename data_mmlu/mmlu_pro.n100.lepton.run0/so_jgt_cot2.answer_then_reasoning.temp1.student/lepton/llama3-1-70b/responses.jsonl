Fiedler's contingency model, which he developed in the 1960s, is a leadership theory that suggests that the effectiveness of a leader depends on the situation in which they are leading. The model takes into account two main factors: the leader's style (either task-oriented or relationship-oriented) and the favorability of the situation (which depends on factors such as the leader's position power, the degree of task structure, and the quality of the leader-member relationship). Fiedler's work on contingency theory has been widely cited and influential in the field of leadership studies.\"}"}, "id": "call-rsNTneNsj2hrcCMJRpwVB4", "type": "function"}]}, "logprobs": {"content": null}, "finish_reason": "stop", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 336, "completion_tokens": 149}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 267, "temperature": 1, "schema_name": "answer_then_reasoning", "should_judge_ground_truth": true, "role": "student"}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-70b"}]
