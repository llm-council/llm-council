This principle aligns with the concept of shareholder primacy. Thus, the correct term should relate to \"shareholders.\"\n\n2. **Duty of Care and Skill**: Managers also have a duty of care and skill.

So, the student's answer \"Interest\" for this component is correct.\n\n2. **Transactions Prohibited Due to Uncertainty and Speculation:** Islamic finance prohibits transactions involving uncertainty (gharar) and speculation (Maisir).

It merely observes the practices and characteristic behavior without making a case for their moral justification or general application.\n3. **Instrumental Stakeholder Theory**: Links stakeholder action with its economic outcomes.

Based on the data, Company B has significantly higher sales ($5,000,000) compared to Company A ($3,000,000). Thus, acquiring Company B would complement Company X's strong administration with Company B's high sales.\n\n(b) X has a strong sales force but a weak administration.\n- This condition implies that Company X is good at generating revenue (strong sales) but needs help with cost management and operations (weak administration). Looking at the data, Company A's profit margins (gross profit as a percentage of sales) are lower compared to Company B, indicating a less efficient operation that a strong administration could improve upon. Therefore, Company A might be a better target for improvement by Company X's administration.\n\n(c) X is looking for short-term improvement in its profits.\n- For short-term profit improvement, the company with higher net income is preferable.
