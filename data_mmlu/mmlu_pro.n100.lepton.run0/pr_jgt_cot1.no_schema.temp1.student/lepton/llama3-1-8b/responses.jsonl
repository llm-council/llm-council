This is related to the concept of **involvement**. Involvement refers to the extent to which employees are informed and consulted about changes in the organization, including downsizing. When employees are involved, they are more likely to understand the reasons behind the downsizing and the consequences for them.\n2. **Severance package**: A second issue associated with downsizing is the **severance package** that employees receive when laid off.

Financial accounting, on the other hand, primarily focuses on the financial performance and position of an organization.\n\n2. Intended audience extending beyond shareholders: This points to a broader scope of users and stakeholders, which is characteristic of social accounting. While financial accounting reports are also used by various stakeholders, the core audience is primarily shareholders. Social accounting, in contrast, often targets stakeholders who have a vested interest in the organization's sustainability and ESG performance, not just financial returns.\n\n3.
