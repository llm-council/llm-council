This complexity arises because corporations are somewhat \"boundaryless.\" This means they don't have clear boundaries or limits that define their privacy. They operate in a variety of settings, from public spaces to private spaces, and their activities can be difficult to monitor or control.\n\n2. **Difficulty in controlling information**: The enforcement of company privacy is also complex because it is difficult to control information. This is due to the number of individuals involved in corporate activities. With many people working together, there are numerous points of data entry, transmission, and storage, making it challenging to ensure that all information is kept confidential.\n\n3. **Much corporate activity takes place in private spaces**: Finally, much corporate activity takes place in private spaces. This includes offices, data centers, and other facilities that are not open to the public. These spaces are typically considered private and are subject to different privacy laws and regulations than public spaces.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer must reflect the complexity of corporate privacy enforcement due to the lack of clear boundaries, the difficulty in controlling information due to the number of individuals involved, and the fact that", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 467, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 307, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-2-3b"}]
