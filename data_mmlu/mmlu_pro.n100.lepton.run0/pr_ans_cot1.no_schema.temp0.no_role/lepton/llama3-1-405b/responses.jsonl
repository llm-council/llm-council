They are more about experiences and less about physical products.\n\n2. **Perishability**: Services are perishable in the sense that they cannot be stored for later use. Once a service is provided, it is consumed immediately.\n\n3. **Variability**: Services can vary significantly in quality and delivery. This variability can be due to factors like the person providing the service, the environment in which the service is provided, and the time at which the service is delivered.\n\n4. **Inseparability**: Services are often inseparable from the provider. This means that the service is provided and consumed at the same time, and the provider is an integral part of the service delivery.\n\n5. **Lack of Ownership**: When a service is consumed, the consumer does not gain ownership of anything tangible. Instead, they pay for the experience or the outcome of the service.\n\nGiven these characteristics, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **A**: Incorrect because it includes \"value\" and \"relationship,\" which are not among the distinct", "tool_calls": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "audio": null, "asr_results": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens": 256}}, {"completion_request": {"question_id": 363, "temperature": 0, "schema_name": null, "should_judge_ground_truth": false, "role": null}, "llm": "lepton://llama3-1-405b"}]
