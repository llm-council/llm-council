This variability can be due to factors like the service provider's expertise, the customer's needs, and the context in which the service is delivered.\n\n4. **Inseparability**: Services are often inseparable from the service provider. This means that the service is typically delivered directly by the provider to the customer, and the customer is involved in the service delivery process.\n\n5. **Lack of ownership**: When customers purchase a service, they do not gain ownership of anything tangible.
