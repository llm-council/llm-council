The term 'co-dependent' (B) generally describes a dysfunctional relationship characterized by excessive emotional reliance or entanglement, which does not align with the description of the workers in the question. Therefore, 'co-dependent' does not apply. The workers having demarcated tasks indicates they are not acting collaboratively (G) to solve complex problems, nor working closely in a cohesive group (C). 'Integrated' (D) does not necessarily imply a lack of inter-group interaction, since an integrated group can still contain a diversity of roles with differing responsibilities. 'Synergistic' (E) often connotes a situation where the group achieves more than the sum of its parts, while this description does not clearly imply this. 'Collaborative' (G) generally implies a team effort and close interaction that would seem at odds with 'distant line managers', implying a lack of integration in the decision-making or implementation processes.
