Transformational leaders are known for inspiring and motivating their followers to exceed their own self-interests for the good of the organization or society, often fostering significant changes in beliefs and practices. \\n\\n1. **Barack Obama** - Known for his inspiring speeches and the transformational change he sought with policies like the Affordable Care Act.\\n2. **Winston Churchill** - A transformational leader during WWII who inspired a nation through his speeches and steadfast leadership.\\n3. **Franklin D. Roosevelt** - Led the U.S. during the Great Depression and WWII with significant New Deal reforms; his leadership is seen as transformational.\\n4. **Martin Luther King Jr.** - A figure of transformational leadership in civil rights, inspiring change through his vision and nonviolent protests.\\n5. **Mikhail Gorbachov** - Known for his role in the transformation of the USSR through policies like Glasnost and Perestroika; his leadership is viewed as transformational.\\n6. **Nelson Mandela** - His leadership in the anti-apartheid movement and as president brought significant social change; widely regarded as transformational.\\n7. **Mahatma Gandhi** - Pioneered a nonviolent movement for India's independence that transformed political activism; considered transformational.\\n8. **Jawaharlal Nehru** - As India's first Prime Minister, he played a key role in shaping modern India, but his methods were often more administrative than inspirational, leading to less recognition as transformational.\\n9. **Bill Clinton** - Known for his approach to politics, though he struggled with scandals that sometimes overshadowed his reforms, not typically viewed as transformational.\\n10. **Margaret Thatcher** - Her policies led to significant change in the UK, but she is often polarizing and more categorized as a transactional rather than transformational leader.\\n\\nWhile several of these leaders are frequently noted for their transformational qualities, **Margaret Thatcher** stands out as a leader whose policies and rhetoric inspired significant change but are often viewed through a lens of division and transactional styles rather than pure transformation.
